# The Amazon Rainforest
The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest spread across the lands of South American continent. 
The forest covers geographical lands in countries Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana hosting 
ecosystems for more than 3 million animal and plant species. Studies suggest this natural beauty absorbs almost 2.2 billion tons of CO2 every year and is so
righteously called the "Lungs of the Earth".
